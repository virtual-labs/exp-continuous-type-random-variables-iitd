##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:

###### Step 1: Select the Distribution
In the simulation step, choose the type of distribution of the random variable, which can be either Discrete or Continuous.

###### Step 2: Set Probability Mass Function (PMF) or Probability Density Function (PDF)
Set all the parameters according to the selected distribution. For example, for the Poisson distribution, ensure that the lambda parameter is set to a value greater than 0.

###### Step 3: Set PMF or PDF Entries
For Probability Mass Function (PMF), set the individual probabilities for each outcome and click 'save'. Click 'show data' to view the complete distribution table.
For the Probability Density Function (PDF), set the interval for which the graph of the PDF needs to be visualized.

###### Step 4: Click the 'Draw' Button
Initiate the experiment by clicking the 'Draw' button. This will generate the graphical representation of the selected distribution based on the parameters and entries you've set.

###### Step 5: View the Graphical Representation
After clicking 'Draw,' observe the graphical representation of the selected distribution. This graph will illustrate the probabilities associated with different outcomes or events within the distribution.
