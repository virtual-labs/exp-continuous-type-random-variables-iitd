##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, Select the distribution of the random variable (Discrete or Continuous).
###### Step 2:  Set all the pmf or pdf according to the selected distribution (for example, For poison, set lambda > 0).
###### Step 3:  For PMF after setting an individual entry, click save. Click show data for the complete distribution table. 
###### Step 3:  For PDF set the interval for which the graph of the PDF need to be visualized.
###### Step 5:  Click the 'Draw' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 6:  Hence, the graphical representation of the selected distribution can be viewed.
